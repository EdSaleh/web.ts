The framework uses TypeScript and easy to learn.\r\nHistory and same hash navigation is supported.\r\n\r\n##WebView Component:\r\nDownload a document from the Internet and use it in your page. \r\nThis component has two methods:-\r\nview(): contains the location of the document to be downloaded. If you location last word after “/” contains a “.” Ex: /file.txt it will do a get request, else or it contains a “?” Or ends with “/” it will do a post request.\r\nresult(doc:Document): callback with the document when it’s finished downloading.\r\ngetElement(doc) method takes first div clone in the document.\r\n##WebView<T> Interface Component:\r\nContains apply(item:T) method to use on a specific area on your page document. getElement(elm) removes \"ts\" class and id from clone, displaying it.\r\n##WebList<T> Component:\r\nIt's a list component with methods such as add/remove(item:T, I?:number), reset(), and length():number that will need to be implemented to create a functional list. addRange(items:T[], I?:number) is already implemented and will use implementation of add() method internally. More methods can be added or creating a constructor if desired to the extending class.\r\n##General:\r\n* main() Method: Allows to execute or create components using hash-link anchors when navigating,\r\nSwitch cases can be assigned based on specific hash command with format #hash-command[/?]args..\r\n* You use hashCommand():string, hashArgs():Object to get the command and the arguments, hashFile():string to get the file path before hash and createQueryString(Object):string to create querystring from a JSON object.\r\n* .web.ts elements are hidden elements.\r\n* a.web are specialized web.ts hash-links - anchors not including \"#\" in [href] will converted to Hijax links, making this link navigate to /#!/[href(no extensions)] ex: href=\"Page.html\" automatically or use [webhref] as navigation link if found.\r\n\r\n[Open Source Project Website Link](https://github.com/medozs/web.ts)\r\n\r\n[Example](http://medozs.github.io/web.ts/)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
